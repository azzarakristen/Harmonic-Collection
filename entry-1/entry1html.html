        This week, Kristen listened to <strong>139 songs</strong>(including repeats) from <strong>82 artists</strong>.
        Of these songs, there were 10 different genres. </center>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
         Here is a breakdown of how many songs - not including repeats - fall into which genres.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul> </p>
            
        <li><strong>  RAP AND HIP HOP:</strong>   37</li>
        
        <li><strong> POP:</strong>   22</li>
      
       <li> <strong> R&B:</strong>   19</li>
       
        <li><strong> INDIE:</strong> 9</li>
       
        <li><strong> ROCK AND ROCK & ROLL:</strong>  8</li>
      
       <li> <strong> FUNK:</strong>  5</li>
       
        <li><strong> BOSSA NOVA:</strong>    5</li>
        
        <li><strong> ELECTRONIC:</strong>    3</li>
       
        <li><strong> INDIE POP:</strong> 2</li>
        
        <li><strong> JAZZ:</strong>  1</li></ul>
            
         <p>   Clearly, rap and hip hop are Kristen's most-listened-to genres of the week. This is typically the case,
        <br> considering that Kristen's time in the gym is almost <em>always</em> spent listening to rap. Pop and R&B are this  
        <br> week's runners-up. </p>
        <br>
        <br>   This week's most-listened-to artists were...
        <ol>
            <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
            <li>Drake</li>
            <li>Justin Timberlake</li>
        </ol> 
        She seems to be fixating on feel-good pop throwbacks.

            THINGS OF NOTE:
        <br><p>Kristen went to a 2-day music festival this weekend, reducing the number of Spotify-listening days to 
        <br>around 5. She heard music from many indie and rock bands.</p></center>
